# AI Automation Agent

This repository contains a prototype automation script that demonstrates how to
collect trending Reddit posts and transform them into short videos for posting on
TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels. The implementation uses placeholder
logic for API integrations and is intended to be imported into n8n for further
workflow automation.

## Features

1. **Trend Research Module**
   - Fetches top posts from target subreddits.
   - Placeholder function for crossâ€‘referencing Google Trends.
2. **Content Transformation Engine**
   - Generates three script variants per post (serious, humorous, dramatic).
3. **Video Production System**
   - Mocks calls to Fliki API for video generation.
4. **Posting Automation**
   - Demonstrates scheduling posts with hashtags.
5. **Monetization & Anti-Saturation**
   - Simple logic to determine sponsorship eligibility and avoid duplicate content.

## Usage

```bash
python automation_agent.py
```

The script prints mock actions to the console. To build a complete system, replace
the placeholder sections with real API calls and import the logic into n8n.
